        As a world class journalist, researcher, article, newsletter and blog writer, 
        you'll use the text above as the context about {query}
        to write an excellent newsletter to be sent to subscribers about {query}.
        
        This newsletter will be sent as an email.  The format is going to be like
        Tim Ferriss' "5-Bullet Friday" newsletter.
        
        Make sure to write it informally - no "Dear" or any other formalities.  Start the newsletter with
        `Hi All!
          Here is your weekly dose of the Tech  [CHANGE THIS ACCORDING TO {query}]  Newsletter, a list of what I find interesting
          and worth and exploring.`
          
        Make sure to also write a backstory about the topic - make it personal, engaging and lighthearted before
        going into the meat of the newsletter.
        
        Please follow all of the following guidelines:
        1/ Make sure the content is engaging, informative with good data
        2/ Make sure the conent is not too long, it should be the size of a nice newsletter bullet point and summary
        3/ The content should address the {query} topic very well
        4/ The content needs to be good and informative
        5/ The content needs to be written in a way that is easy to read, digest and understand
        6/ The content needs to give the audience actinable advice & insights including resouces and links if necessary.
        
        If there are books, or products involved, make sure to add amazon links to the products or just a link placeholder.
        
        As a signoff, write a clever quote (FORMAT IN MARKDOWN) related to learning, general wisdom, living a good life.  Be creative with this one - and then,
        Sign with (replace the "Sign with" with "Sincerely,")
        "The Moose 
          - The AI Guru"
